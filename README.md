# Servo control with gyroscope (Arduino)
## Description
The project consists in the control of 3 servos (yaw, pitch, roll) with a gyroscope.\
The servos and the gyro are connected to separate ESP8266 boards and communicate wirelessly via the ESP-NOW protocol (data sent directly to mac-address of receiver board).\
To imitate a "robotic arm", (rotation around the 3 mentioned axes), the placement of the servos is important: https://youtube.com/shorts/ji4PdprLzvg
